      "As a job seeker myself, I know that looking for a full-time job is not for the faint of heart. Even the smallest things can effect an impression. Since this is the case, I decided to mock up an online store that helps job seekers find professional-looking, worry-free clothing.",
      "My site features interview-worthy clothing for men and women of all ages. I used this project as an opportunity to play with the Stripe API, which makes incorporating payments a cinch. Stripe even has a feature for Bitcoin payments, which I will have to explore in the future!"
