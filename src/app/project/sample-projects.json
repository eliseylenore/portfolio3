        {"text": "I built this website with a lovely group of students at Epicodus(coding bootcamp). I like to say it is like a Linked In for startups. The app allows users to showcase their skills and get resources and support they need to make their ideas a reality. It also provides an opportunity to share it with a vibrant community of people."},
        {"text": "My main role in this project was to create the models necessary. We had five different models to create: user, category, contact, need and project. My team talked about what would be necessary for each before creating the models. We also modified them quite a bit as we went along."}, 
        {"text": "My second task was to beautify the project using the Bootstrap front-end framework. I referred to Bootsnip, a website that showcases bits of Bootstrap code that people have used for different parts of their websites, such as the carousel or menu. Bootstrap really does make all styling so quick and easy!"}
