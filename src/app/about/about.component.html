    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify">I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Illustration in 2013, and then worked for an online investing company. After three years of talking about the stock market all day, I decided it was time for a change. I enrolled in Epicodus, a 5-month programming bootcamp with a brand-new campus in Seattle. </p>
    <p>After graduating from Epicodus in July 2017 (with internship experience!), I have been honing my knowledge of data structures. Programming combines the skills I learned in those two very different environments. Coding lets me use the creativity I practiced when going to school, while also using the attention to detail I developed while in the financial industry.</p>
    <p>In my freetime, I still love to draw. For health, I run, practice yoga, and play wiffle ball.</p>
